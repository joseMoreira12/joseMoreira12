          <p>Me and my best friends fortunatly have similar tastes on music and we hang out a lot. About 2 years ago we're talking, and randomly we said "What if we started a band?". On that time it was only a joke and we didn't actually mean it. I only had a guitar so I was playing guitar and so as well my friend João Cunha, but he would sing as well. On the drums, Zé Miguel, the only one who actually studied music. And like that we had a band.
On the beginning we only though on doing covers, we didn't have any songs right ? A little time has passed and we're getting even better so we started doing a tribute to Bush( a grunge band from the 90's).
On the meantime I bought a bass, since we really need one and I always loved the bass. This moment was a turning point. We started getting ambitious in a short time window.
Music started being composed and melodies created. In  only a few months we had our first concert! It was a really impacted show. We loved it and also the audience...it was really incredible.
2 years have passed, and we already did so many concertes abnd we're about to start recording our first album.
So stay tuned and soon enough Mudha first album will come out!</p>
